    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Home life</h2>
    <p id="self-intro">
        <!-- Home life -->
        I am from the small city of Ridgecrest, CA, located in the middle of the Mojave desert next to a Naval Air Base.
        I love hanging out with my small family of 4. We've adopted 3 fluffy pets that like to run around and sleep inside and outside.
        I like to keep myself busy by coding, crafting, practicing piano, cooking, cleaning, and playing video games.
    </p>
    <h2>School Life</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- School Life -->
        I am studying Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho.
        While at school I have worked as a Computer Science TA for Programming Building Blocks in Python and Object Oriented Programming in C++. 
        I was elected as the Vice President of the Society of Women's Engineer Club for Fall 2020 and I am excited to help plan and organise remote activities as a leader.
        With a background interest 
        in art and design, I have taken an interest in the front end aspect 
        of software design.
