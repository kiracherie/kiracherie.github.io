        <p id="self-intro">
            <!-- Home life -->
            I am from the small city of Ridgecrest, CA, located in the middle of the Mojave desert.
            I love hanging out with my small family of 4. We've adopted 3 fluffy pets that like to run around and sleep inside and outside.
            I like to keep myself busy by coding, crafting, practicing piano, cooking, cleaning, and playing video games.
        </p>

            <!-- School Life -->
            I am studying Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho.
            While at school I have worked as a Computer Science TA for Programming Building Blocks in Python and Object Oriented Programming in C++. 
            I was elected as the Vice President of the Society of Women's Engineer Club for Fall 2020 and I am excited to help plan and organise remote activities as a leader.
            With a background interest 
            in art and design, I have taken an interest in the front end aspect 
            of software design.
