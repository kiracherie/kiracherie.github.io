                            It is often the small things that
                            add up and make a huge difference. Small things are very
                            important in programming. If one small thing is out of place, then the whole 
                            program could collapse!

                <p id="self-intro">
                    <!-- Home life -->
                    I am from the small city of Ridgecrest, CA, located in the middle of the Mojave desert next to a Naval Air Base.
                    I love hanging out with my small family of 4. We've adopted 3 fluffy pets that like to run around and sleep inside and outside.
                    I like to keep myself busy by coding, crafting, practicing piano, cooking, cleaning, and playing video games.
                </p>
                <h3>School Life</h3>
                <p>
                    <!-- School Life -->
                    I am studying Software Engineering at BYU-Idaho.
                    While at school I have worked as a Computer Science TA for Programming Building Blocks in Python and Object Oriented Programming in C++. 
                    I was elected as the Vice President of the Society of Women's Engineer Club for Fall 2020 and I am excited to help plan and organise remote activities as a leader.
                    With a background interest 
                    in art and design, I have taken an interest in the front end aspect 
                    of software design.
